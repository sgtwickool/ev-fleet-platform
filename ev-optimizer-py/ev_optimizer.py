# Example JSON payload for /optimize-trip:
# {
#   "distance_matrix": [
#     [0, 20, 18, 12],
#     [20, 0, 30, 14],
#     [18, 30, 0, 22],
#     [12, 14, 22, 0]
#   ],
#   "num_vehicles": 2,
#   "depot": 0
# }
#
# - distance_matrix: 2D array, where [i][j] is the distance from location i to j.
# - num_vehicles: number of vehicles in the fleet.
# - depot: index of the depot in the distance matrix (usually 0).
#
# You can POST this JSON to /optimize-trip to get optimized routes.
